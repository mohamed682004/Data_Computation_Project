In our BRFSS Diabetes Prediction project, we applied various techniques including PCA (both using libraries and manual implementation), AIC and backward feature selection, and finally trained an SVM classifier using an RBF kernel with SMOTE to handle class imbalance. However, before finalizing this project, we explored a more challenging and ambitious idea: predicting protein localization using the Human Protein Atlas Image Classification dataset from Kaggle.

In this more advanced project, we aimed to classify the type of proteins within human cells based on fluorescent microscopy images. We built a custom CNN model to extract deep features from the images, and then used an SVM classifier (instead of a softmax output layer) to perform the final multi-class prediction. The CNN was trained on resized 32x32 RGB images extracted from the 4-channel TIFFs (red, green, blue, yellow), and feature vectors were passed to a One-vs-Rest SVM for classification.

Despite the complexity and time invested, the model achieved a low public leaderboard F1 score of around 0.04, placing us at approximately 2000th position. Given the low performance and the competition's difficulty, we made the decision to shift focus to the BRFSS project, where we had better control over the preprocessing, feature engineering, and interpretability of the results.

Nonetheless, this attempt at the Human Protein Atlas competition was a valuable learning experience in handling real-world multi-label image data, feature extraction from CNNs, and SVM integration. It demonstrated the challenges of medical image classification and the importance of both data understanding and model interpretability.
